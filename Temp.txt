final url = Uri.parse('https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signUp?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>')
http.post(url, ...)

final url = Uri.parse('https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signInWithPassword?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>')
http.post(url, ...)







The http package we added in the last lecture changed slightly with its last versions.

In the next lecture, we'll send a POST request to an API endpoint with a URL.

For this, in the lecture, I'll do this:

const url = '...'
http.post(url, ...)
As of version 0.13.0 or higher of the http package, url can't be a string (i.e. plain text) anymore.

You have two options:

1) Use an older version of the http package: E.g. set http: 0.12.2 in your pubspec.yaml file

2) Convert url from a string to a "Url object" (and also change const to final):

final url = Uri.parse('<your-url>')
http.post(url, ...)
For example, my code from the next lecture should look like this:

final url = Uri.parse('https://flutter-update.firebaseio.com/products.json')
http.post(url, ...)
Alternatively, you can also use this syntax:

final url = Uri.https('flutter-update.firebaseio.com', '/products.json')
http.post(url, ...)
